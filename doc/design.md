# Game flow
* Universe update science data: update common sense and generate new projects
* (Parallel) Mechanism: Universe server modify players' data based on game mechanism, clean up eventData
  the produced command should execute on self and neighbor
* (Parallel) Commands: universe server execute commands based on the space-time interval
* Check: e.g. player dead, new player
* Clean up newPlayerList stored in PlayerData
* Universe server update the universe data by replacing the latest slice 
* Universe server is ready after save  
* Enable universe access by client
* (Parallel) AI: Universe server run the ai to determine command list
* Universe client check if the universe server is ready, if ready, download 3D view
* Universe client render the gui based on the 3D View
* Universe client decide the command list
* Universe client send the command list to the universe server
* Universe server wait a certain duration
  * If all human player sent command list, continue
  * If some players join, add human player and prioritize them over ai generated command
  * If some/all players haven't sent back their command list within the time limit, use ai generated command
* Disable universe by client
* Change player type based on whether it has human input
* (Parallel) Universe server execute the self-command and neighbor-command, others are stored
* Universe server move player by their velocity, update int4D, also update group id by their double4D position
* Universe server convert mutable data to immutable data, save latest data, drop oldest data

# Command, Event, Mechanism, AI, and Data
* Commands and events are more definite, having only one possible implementation
  , their behaviours should be defined in their class,
  where other data can have different mechanisms (i.e. mods), those data are handle externally and
  should not be defined within the class, except some universal utils function
* Command collection is global, pick by command collection name
* Mechanism is global, pick by mechanism collection name
* AI is individual, pick by aiName
* data is separated into two category 
  * Core data which is common for all model
  * Subsystem data which can be added or removed for individual models

# Command
* From player, to player
* Receive time: based on spacetime interval

# Event
* Contains information and choices
* Player send command to determine the choice, then the choice has a command to be executed
* If no player do not choice, the default command is executed

# Active vs passive event
* Active: player can add event on himself or other by command
* Passive: generated by the game mechanism, e.g., diffusion of tech

# Research
* A network of knowledge in a 2d plane
* Knowledge affect modifier
* Store and send only the id of the knowledge, and the overall modifier to reduce data used
* Scientist work at institute
* Institute has a center in the 2d plane, and a range
* Encourage new institute by reducing the growth speed of the range
* Knowledge diffusion: easier within same leader?

# Industry
* Produce resources
* Depends on research modifier
* Encourage newly build industry at new place: more modifier, harder to add new one

# Economy
* Transport resources produce by industry
* Tax and tariff
* Subsidize

# Pop system
* Daily need of population: food, energy, entertainment
* Special need at factory
* Each type of population has wealth
* Prefer low cost or high quality stuff
* Quality preference can increase or decrease

# Military
* Solder population
* Attack, reduce attack, reduce defense
* Ratio defense, absolute magnitude defense

# Political
* Democracy vs Authoritarianism
* Policy: capitalism vs socialism

# Diplomacy
* Ally, enemy, puppet
