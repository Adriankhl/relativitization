* Cloth: animal, plastic
* Research equipment: animal, metal
* Household good: plant, plastic
* Medicine: plant, metal
* Ammunition: metal, plastic

# Amount mechanism design

## System
* Stellar system mass ~ 1E30, ideal pop = mass / 1E20 ~ 1E10
* Ship mass ~ 1E6 * tech, ideal pop = mass ~ 1E6 * tech
  
## Production
* Base stellar fuel production = mass / 1E24 ~ 1E6 per time
* Max fuel production per cube by factory = 1E9
* Entertainment resource = entertainer pop size * 20 per time
  
## Consumption
* Population desire resource amount = population size
* Ideal fuel factory production = 1 per employee per turn, employee required is reduced by tech
