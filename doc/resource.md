# Fuel
* Fuel is used for all types of production, and it is distinct from other resources

# Entertainment
* Is not produced by factory

# Primary resource produced by factory
* Plant
* Animal
* Metal
* Plastic

# Secondary resource produced by factory, and its dependency on primary resource
* Food: animal, plant
* Cloth: animal, plastic
* Household good: plant, plastic
* Research equipment: animal, metal
* Medicine: plant, metal
* Ammunition: metal, plastic

# Tech impact
* Ship: architecture, energy
* Fuel: energy
* Plant: environment
* Animal: biomedical
* Metal: machinery
* Plastic: chemical
* Food: food
* Cloth: material
* Household good: art
* Research equipment: material
* Medicine: biomedical
* Ammunition: military
* Entertainment: information technology

# Amount mechanism design

## System
* Stellar system mass ~ 1E30, ideal pop = mass / 1E20 ~ 1E10
* Ship mass ~ 1E6 * tech, ideal pop = mass ~ 1E6 * tech
  
## Production
* Base stellar fuel production = mass / 1E24 ~ 1E6 per time
* Max fuel production per cube by factory = 1E9
* Entertainment resource = entertainer pop size * 20 per time

## Factory production
* Amount increases by technology
* Basic fuel factory: 1E4 employee, 2E5 output
* Basic food, cloth, household good factory: 1E4 employee, 2E4 fuel consumption, 5E6 output, 1 input per input resource
* Basic food, cloth, household good factory: 1E4 employee, 2E4 fuel consumption, 2E6 output, 1 input per input resource
* Research equipment, medicine, ammunition factory: 1E4 employee, 2E4 fuel consumption, 2E5 output, 1 input per input resource
  
## Consumption
* Minimum population desire resource amount = population size, (TODO) increases if population has more money and if there are more left in trade
