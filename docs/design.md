# Game flow
* Mechanism(Parallel): Universe server modify players' data based on game mechanism, clean up eventData
  the produced command should execute on self and attached neighbor
* Commands(Parallel): universe server execute commands based on the space-time interval
* Check: e.g. player dead, new player
* Clean up newPlayerList stored in PlayerData
* Universe server update the universe data by replacing the latest slice 
* Universe server is ready after save  
* AI(Parallel): Universe server run the ai to determine command list
* Universe client check if the universe server is ready, if ready, download 3D view
* Universe client render the gui based on the 3D View
* Universe client decide the command list
* Universe client send the command list to the universe server
* Universe server wait a certain duration
  * If all human player sent command list, continue
  * If some players join, add human player and prioritize them over ai generated command
  * If some/all players haven't sent back their command list within the time limit, use ai generated command   
* Universe server execute the self-command and neighbor-command, others are stored
* Universe server move player by their velocity, update time
* Universe server convert mutable data to immutable data, save latest data, drop oldest data

# Command
* From player, to player
* Receive time: based on spacetime interval

# Event
* Contains information and choices
* Player send command to determine the choice, then the choice has a command to be executed
* If no player do not choice, the default command is executed

# Active vs passive event
* Active: player can add event on himself or other by command
* Passive: generated by the game mechanism, e.g., diffusion of tech
