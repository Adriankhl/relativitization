# Game flow
* (Parallel) Mechanism: Universe server modify players' data based on game mechanism, clean up eventData
  the produced command should execute on self and attached neighbor
* (Parallel) Commands: universe server execute commands based on the space-time interval
* Check: e.g. player dead, new player
* Clean up newPlayerList stored in PlayerData
* Universe server update the universe data by replacing the latest slice 
* Universe server is ready after save  
* Can access  universe
* (Parallel) AI: Universe server run the ai to determine command list
* Universe client check if the universe server is ready, if ready, download 3D view
* Universe client render the gui based on the 3D View
* Universe client decide the command list
* Universe client send the command list to the universe server
* Universe server wait a certain duration
  * If all human player sent command list, continue
  * If some players join, add human player and prioritize them over ai generated command
  * If some/all players haven't sent back their command list within the time limit, use ai generated command
* Can't access universe
* Change player type based on whether it has human input
* (Parallel) Universe server execute the self-command and neighbor-command, others are stored
* Universe server move player by their velocity, update int4D, also update attached id by their double4D position
* Universe server convert mutable data to immutable data, save latest data, drop oldest data

# Command
* From player, to player
* Receive time: based on spacetime interval

# Event
* Contains information and choices
* Player send command to determine the choice, then the choice has a command to be executed
* If no player do not choice, the default command is executed

# Active vs passive event
* Active: player can add event on himself or other by command
* Passive: generated by the game mechanism, e.g., diffusion of tech

# Research
* A network of knowledge in a 2d plane
* Knowledge affect modifier
* Store and send only the id of the knowledge and the overall modifier to reduce data used
* Scientist work at institute
* Institute has a center in the 2d plane, and a range
* Encourage new institute by reducing the growth speed of the range
* Knowledge diffusion: easier within same leader?

# Industry
* Produce resources
* Depends on research modifier
* Encourage newly build industry at new place: more modifier, harder to add new one
