# Summary

`Relativitization` is a Kotlin project which provides a simulation framework for
agent-based modeling in 4D, relativistics spacetime.
Agent-based simulation is a popular technique in social science to explore
social phenomena in hypothetical societies.
We are interested in one particular type of hypothetical societies,
interstellar societies.
Because of special relativity, interstellar societies should be modeled and simulated
in 4D, Minkowski spacetime.
`Relativitization`, or more precisely, the `universe-core` subproject,
provides a set of building blocks and enforces a specific way to implement a model,
such that some of the physical constraints are automatically satisfied.

The source code is available at [https://github.com/Adriankhl/relativitization](https://github.com/Adriankhl/relativitization),
the repository contains the code of a turn-based strategy game built on top of the framework,
and only the `universe-core` subproject is relevant for this paper.
The documentation about the framework is available at
[https://github.com/Adriankhl/relativitization-framework-doc](https://github.com/Adriankhl/relativitization-framework-doc).
